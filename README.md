Another project from Boot Dev, this time making a very basic version of the classic game Asteroids.

This was the first one I did using OOP and had it's own struggles.  
It was an interesting learning classes and making sure each part of the code was referencing each other.
For future I think I may need to start drawing out maps to give myself more of a visual representation of relationships within the code.
